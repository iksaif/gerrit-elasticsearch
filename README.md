# Gerrit ElasticSearch

Set of tools to import and browse gerrit data in ES.
This might become easier to do in the future with https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/v2.14.2/gerrit-elasticsearch/

Also https://github.com/GerritCodeReview/apps_analytics-etl looks promising

Uses gerrit_downloader.sh from https://github.com/holmari/gerritstats
